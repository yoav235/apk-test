# Project Expansions Overview

## 1. MVVM Architecture
The project has been structured using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture.
This design pattern separates the development of the graphical user interface from
the business logic and data models, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase.
The ViewModel manages the UI-related data and business logic, while the View observes
the ViewModel, making updates as needed. This separation enhances the scalability of
the application.

## 2. Retrofit Integration
Retrofit has been integrated for managing network operations, allowing for easy
interaction with RESTful APIs. The `ApiClient` and `ApiService` classes manage the
network requests, ensuring that the application can retrieve and send data to a remote
server efficiently.

## 3. Room Database
The project uses the Room Persistence Library to handle local data storage. This
integration simplifies database operations and provides a robust abstraction layer
over SQLite. The `AppDatabase`, `UserDao`, and `UserModel` classes facilitate the
storage, retrieval, and manipulation of user data.

## 4. Glide for Image Loading
Glide has been implemented for efficient image loading and caching in the `UserView`
class. This ensures that images are loaded quickly and efficiently, improving the
overall performance and user experience.

## 5. Custom Dialogs
Custom dialogs have been implemented for user interactions, such as adding and
deleting users. These dialogs are defined in the `dialog_add_user.xml` layout file,
ensuring a consistent and customizable user interface.

## 6. Theming and Styling
The project supports both light and dark themes, following Material Design 3
guidelines. Colors and styles are defined in `colors.xml` and `themes.xml`, ensuring
a consistent look and feel across the application and enhancing accessibility.

## 7. RecyclerView for Data Display
A RecyclerView has been implemented for displaying a list of users, leveraging the
`user_item.xml` layout. This approach provides a performant and flexible way to
display a large set of data.

## 8. Multi-Selection of Users
The application supports multi-selection of users within the RecyclerView, allowing
users to select multiple items simultaneously. This feature enhances user interaction
by enabling batch operations, such as deleting multiple users at once.

## 9. ViewModel and LiveData
The ViewModel and LiveData components are used to manage UI-related data in a
lifecycle-conscious way. This ensures that data survives configuration changes,
such as screen rotations, without leaking memory.

## 10. Error Handling
Error handling is managed within the ViewModel, ensuring that the UI remains
responsive and user-friendly, even in case of network failures or data errors.

## 11. Dark Theme Support
The application includes a fully implemented dark theme, which automatically adapts
to the system's dark mode settings. This ensures a comfortable user experience in
low-light environments and helps reduce battery consumption on OLED screens.

## 12. Localization Ready
The project has been structured to support localization, with user-facing strings
stored in `strings.xml`. This will make it easier to translate the app into multiple
languages in the future.
